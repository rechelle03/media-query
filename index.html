                    <p>Women with Baskets, Fish, and Crab was among the favorite paintings of the artist, Anita Magsaysay-Ho, displayed prominently in her living room before finding a home with one of her oldest friends. The piece melds together a celebration of Filipino craft, the strength of Filipina women, and the talent and technique of one of the country’s most celebrated painters. The baskets depicted invoke the industriousness and dedication involved in basket weaving—a practice Anita considered among the most beautiful of Filipino handicrafts</p>

                    <p><b>Anita Magsaysay-Ho</b> was a Filipino painter best known for her Social Realist and post-Cubist portrayals of Filipino life and culture, notably and frequently portraying groups of women engaged in labor. Born on May 25, 1914 in Manila, the Philippines, Magsaysay-Ho studied under Fernando Amorsolo at the University of the Philippines' School of Fine Arts before moving to the United States to study at the Cranbrook Academy in Michigan. Her work centered around the central tenets of Modernism, garnering her inclusion in the Filipino artist group the Thirteen Moderns—the only woman to do so. Magsaysay-Ho received significant critical acclaim and recognition for her work before her death on May 5, 2012, including first prize at the Philippine Art Association in 1952. Her work can be found among the collections of institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, and the Ateneo Art Gallery in Manila, Philippines.</p>
